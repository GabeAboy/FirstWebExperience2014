        <h1>The changes I made to the Green Cab website!</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>I changed the navigation bar from images to code, and adding css to style </li>
            <li>I removed the Ride Green tab it was irrelivent to what the consumers are looking for. By removing
            this tab it cleans the page, and removes shouting</li>
            <li>Putting the request a ride in the center allows the consumer to easily locate
            the order a taxi online bar</li>
            <li>To the Fare calculator I took out some unnecessary comments for the title. Also
            removed text and made it a link instead.</li>
            <li>Our philosophy tab I moved it to a nice location, also removed unnecessary text. </li>
        </ol>
